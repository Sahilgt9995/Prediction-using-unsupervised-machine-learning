Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML

Task: from given 'iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

*Intro:* 

1. K-means is a centroid-based algorithm or a distance-based algorithm, 
where we calculate the distance to assign a point to a cluster in K-means

2. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to find groups which have not been explicitly labeled in the data. 

3. This can be used to confirm business assumptions about what types of groups exist or to identify unknown groups in complex data sets.
